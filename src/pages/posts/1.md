## It is a daunting process with lots of 'distractions'

It's 2022 and front-end frameworks and libraries pop-up one after another. It can be quite daunting etcetera.

Using nuxt for a couple of months made me feel like I have been left out of all the other frameworks that have been getting praise online. Frameworks like svelte, remix, astro, and nextjs.

Looking into these I found out about prisma, tRPC, and railway.
